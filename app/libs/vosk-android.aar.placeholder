This is a placeholder for the Vosk Android ASR model.
In a real implementation, you would need to download the Vosk Android AAR from:
https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-android/releases

And place it in the app/libs directory as vosk-android.aar.

The Dutch language model should be placed in:
app/src/main/assets/models/nl/

You can download the Dutch model from:
